Whenever you need details about the HTML structure, element selectors, or JavaScript interaction logic for a specific website (like ChatGPT or Claude), I will generate a prompt outlining the exact information required. You can then use this prompt with another LLM that has access to the full HTML source of the target page.

You will keep prd.md, progress.md, dump.md  and rules.md in mind and refer to them as needed during our development process.
You will dump (in dump.md) a detailed summary of whatever happened in the chat to transfer the context of our session to a new LLM instance. This outlines the project's vision, its current functional state, the significant challenges we overcame and our learnings and where we went wrong and our wrong asumptions.
